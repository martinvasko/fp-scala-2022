# WS 2022/2023 course of "Introduction into Functional Programming with Scala"

All samples require a working Scala installation.
The latest Scala SDK can be downloaded here: [Scala Download](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

The samples in Getting started are mostly adopted from the [Tour of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) which is a great place to get started with Scala in depth.

## Getting Started with Scala

`cd getting-started`
`scala <filename>.scala`

All samples can be started by calling the `scala` command..

## Getting Started with Functional Programming concepts

`cd functional-programming`

This app is using [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to manage the build lifecycle.
To start the CLI, run `sbt`. 
To start the app, enter `run`.
There are (far) more commands available, see the [sbt documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Command-Line-Reference.html) for more information.

## Further concepts

### Akka streams

`cd streams`

This app is using [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to manage the build lifecycle.
To start the CLI, run `sbt`. 
To start the app, enter `run`.

Basically these samples are taken from the [Akka Streams Quickstart](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-quickstart.html).
Check out the [Akka Streams documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html) for more information.
